Federal milk order program is recognized widely as one of the benefits of this program. These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.\r\n\r\nAfter the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.\r\n\r\nThe Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report.

The dataset depicted in this map service provides a watershed index of surface drinking water importance, a watershed index of forest importance to surface drinking water, and a watershed index to highlight the extent to which development, fire, and insects and disease threaten forests important for surface drinking water. This tabular dataset is meant to be joined with the NRCS Watershed Boundary Dataset HUC-12. The results of this assessment provides information that can identify areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality. The spatial dataset can be incorporated into broad-scale planning, such as the State Forest Action Plans, and can be incorporated into existing decision support tools that currently lack spatial data on important areas for surface drinking water. This project also sets the groundwork for identifying watersheds where a payment for watershed services (PWS) scheme may be an option for financing forest conservation and management on private unprotected forest lands. In perhaps its most important but most basic role, this work can serve as an education tool helping to illustrate the link between forests and provision of key watershed-based ecosystem services.", "modified": "2014-12-23T20:03:26.662449", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "USDA-FS-00014", "landingPage": "http://apps.fs.fed.us/ArcX/rest/services/EDW/EDW_ForestsToFaucets_01/MapServer", "license": "https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0", "temporal": "2013/2014", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "US Forest Service, Department of Agriculture"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Dave Green", "hasEmail": "mailto:data@fs.fed.us"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "text/html", "format": "ArcGIS Map Service", "title": "U.S. Forest Service Surface Drinking Water Importance", "description": "A map service on the www depicting watershed indexes to help identify areas of interest for protecting surface drinking water quality.

Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined.  They are also the basic units for State land resource maps.  LRUs are typically coextensive with State general soil map units, but some general soil map units are subdivided into LRUs because of significant geographic differences in soils, climate, water resources, or land use.  LRUs generally are several thousand acres in size.  A unit can be one continuous area or several separate areas that are near each other.  In 2005, these areas were designated as common resource areas (CRAs) within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  CRAs are created by subdividing MLRAs by topography, other landscape features, hydrologic units, resource concerns, resource uses, and human considerations affecting use and soil and water conservation treatment needs.  Common resource areas, or land resource units, are not described in this handbook and are not shown on the national map.  Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units.  Land resource regions are a group of geographically associated major land resource areas. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.  In order to make this handbook more useful to other Federal agencies and private parties using ecological regions for planning or evaluation of natural resources programs and policies, Appendix I (Agriculture Handbook 296, 2006) cross-references MLRAs with Environmental Protection Agency Level III Ecoregions (USEPA, 2003; Omernik, 1987) and U.S. Forest Service ecological sections (Cleland and others, 2005; McNab and others, 2005).  In this handbook, major land resource areas are generally designated by Arabic numbers and identified by a descriptive geographic name.  Examples are MLRA 1 (Northern Pacific Coast Range, Foothills, and Valleys); MLRA 154 (South-Central Florida Ridge); and MLRA 230 (Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands).  Some MLRAs are designated by an Arabic number and a letter because previously established MLRAs have been divided into smaller, more homogeneous areas, for example, MLRAs 102A, 102B, and 102C.  The use of numbers and letters to identify the newly created MLRAs requires fewer changes in existing information in records and in databases.  A few MLRAs consist of two or more parts separated for short distances by other land resource areas.  In places one of these parts is widely separated from the main body of the MLRA and is in an adjoining LRR.  The description of the respective MLRA also applies to these outlying parts.", "modified": "2015-05-24", "accessLevel": "public", "identifier": "NRCS0106", "spatial": "United State, Territories, Commonwealths, Island Nations", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "NRCS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Soils Hotline", "hasEmail": "mailto:soilshotline@lin.usda.gov"}, "distribution": [{"@type": "dcat:Distribution", "mediaType": "text/html", "title": "Major Land Resource Area Maps", "description": "Provides a service for ordering geospatial datasets of MLRA areas.", "downloadURL": "http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov"}], "keyword": ["CRA", "Common Resource Area", "LRR", "LRU", "Land Resource Region", "Land Resource Unit", "MLRA", "Major Land Resource Area", "NGDA", "NGDA Portfolio Theme", "National Geospatial Data Asset", "Soils Theme", "soils"], "bureauCode": ["005:53"], "programCode": ["005:027"], "theme": ["Geospatial", "Soils Theme", "National Geospatial Data Asset"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "title": "Mappersde", "description": "ArcMap supporting data", "modified": "2014-02-27T19:18:29.991564", "accessLevel": "non-public", "identifier": "NRCS0037", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "NRCS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Eva Mitter", "hasEmail": "mailto:eva.mitter@wdc.usda.gov"}, "keyword": ["Misc"], "bureauCode": ["005:53"], "programCode": ["005:027"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "title": "mrtxdb", "description": "Master Reference Tables", "modified": "2014-02-27T19:18:46.647352", "accessLevel": "non-public", "identifier": "NRCS0038", "publisher": {"@type": "org:Organization", "name": "NRCS"}, "contactPoint": {"@type": "vcard:Contact", "fn": "Eva Mitter", "hasEmail": "mailto:eva.mitter@wdc.usda.gov"}, "keyword": ["Systems Reference Data"], "bureauCode": ["005:53"], "programCode": ["005:027"]}, {"@type": "dcat:Dataset", "title": "NASIS", "description": "Web Soil Survey (WSS) provides soil data and information produced by the National Cooperative Soil Survey.
