"",Rural-Urban Commuting Area Codes,"The rural-urban commuting area codes (RUCA) classify U.S. census tracts using measures of urbanization, population density, and daily commuting from the decennial census.

The most recent RUCA codes are based on data from the 2000 decennial census. The classification contains two levels. Whole numbers (1-10) delineate metropolitan, micropolitan, small town, and rural commuting areas based on the size and direction of the primary (largest) commuting flows. These 10 codes are further subdivided to permit stricter or looser delimitation of commuting areas, based on secondary (second largest) commuting flows. The approach errs in the direction of more codes, providing flexibility in combining levels to meet varying definitional needs and preferences.
 
The 1990 codes are similarly defined. However, the Census Bureau's methods of defining urban cores and clusters changed between the two censuses. And, census tracts changed in number and shapes. The 2000 rural-urban commuting codes are not directly comparable with the 1990 codes because of these differences.

Farmers and policymakers are interested in the level of counter-cyclical payments (CCPs) provided by the 2008 Farm Act to producers of selected commodities. CCPs are based on the season-average price received by farmers. (For more information on CCPs, see the ERS 2008 Farm Bill Side-By-Side, Title I: Commodity Programs.)

Users can view the model forecasts or create their own forecast by inserting different values for futures prices, basis values, or marketing weights. Example computations and data are provided on the Documentation page.

#### Spreadsheet Models
 
For each of the three major U.S. field crops, the Excel spreadsheet model computes a forecast for:

1. the national-level season-average price received by farmers and
2. the implied counter-cyclical payment rate.

Release 2 of the DSID reports national estimates for vitamins and minerals in adult and children's multivitamins (MVMs) ( http://dsid.usda.nih.gov).  For the DSID studies, representative supplement products are identified, sampled and analyzed by experienced laboratories. In order to obtain accurate results, a quality assurance and quality control plan are established for each study, with standard reference materials, in-house control materials and product duplicate results assessed before product data are accepted as final.  Laboratory data are then statistically evaluated by ingredient and weighted by market share information, if available. For the MVM studies released in DSID-2, data are reported by ingredient across a range of labeled levels.  Results are predicted by regression and estimate mean percent differences from label and standard errors at these labeled levels. These data can be used by researchers to more accurately quantify nutrient intake from dietary supplements.","application/vnd.ms-excel, null","http://dsid.usda.nih.gov/dsid_database/DSID3CombinedDataFiles.xlsx, null",irregular,005:18,joel.palachuvattil@ars.usda.gov,Joel Palachuvattil,,005:040;,"Agricultural Research Service, Department of Agriculture",public,,dietary supplement;multivitamin;nutrient composition of foods;nutrition;vitamin;,2014-12-23,2009-05-01,USDA-ARS-00009,http://dsid.usda.nih.gov/dsid_database/DataFileDescription3-22-12.pdf,https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0,contiguous United States,2003/2008,,,,,http://dsid.usda.nih.gov/research_summary.html;,,,

"",Legume Information System,"LIS stores genetic and genomic data for crops and modal species in the legume family. LIS stores datasets from numerous legumes through species-specific webpages, and uses the reference species Glycine max, Lotus japonicus, and Medicago truncatula as a basis for comparisons between and among diverse legume species. Other genomes are being added as they become available. For other legume species, LIS hosts transcriptome assemblies (both traditional EST and NGS-based) and other datasets. Comparative maps, reference datasets, sequence search tools, etc. make these datasets available for exploration and discovery. New features in 2013 include powerful new sequence-search methods and interfaces; new genome browsers for chickpea, common bean, and pigeonpea; inferred syntenic relationships between all sequenced legume genomes; and a new database of trait and QTL data for bean and peanut.

"",Milk Marketing Order Statistics,"The statistical data generated through the administration of the Federal milk order program is recognized widely as one of the benefits of this program. These data provide comprehensive and accurate information on milk supplies, utilization, and sales, as well as class prices established under the orders and prices paid to dairy farmers (producers). The sources of this data are monthly reports of receipts and utilization, producer payroll reports, and reports of nonpool handlers filed by milk processors (handlers) subject to the provisions of the various milk orders. The local market administrator (MA) uses these reports to determine pool obligations under the order and to verify proper payments to producers. Auditors employed by the MA review handler records to assure the accuracy of reported information. Reporting errors are corrected; if necessary, pool obligations are revised.

After the pool obligations have been determined the local market administrator summarizes the individual handler reports and submits a series of order summary reports to the Market Information Branch (MIB) in Dairy Programs. The MIB summarizes the individual order data and disseminates this information via monthly, bimonthly, and annual releases or publications. Since milk marketing order statistics are based on reports filed by the population of possible reporting firms and not a sample, these statistics are comprehensive. Also, since these individual firm reports are subject to audit and verification, these statistics are accurate.

The Federal milk order statistics database contains historical information, beginning in January 2000, generated by the administration of the Federal milk order program. Most of the information in the database has been published previously by the Market Information Branch in Dairy Programs either on its web site or in the Dairy Market News Report. New users are encouraged to use the ""User Guide"" to learn how to navigate the search screens.

"",Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO-10) Database for the Conterminous United States - 10 meter,"This dataset is called the Gridded SSURGO (gSSURGO) Database and is derived from the Soil Survey Geographic (SSURGO) Database. SSURGO is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey (NCSS) in accordance with NCSS mapping standards. The tabular data represent the soil attributes, and are derived from properties and characteristics stored in the National Soil Information System (NASIS). The gSSURGO data were prepared by merging traditional SSURGO digital vector map and tabular data into a Conterminous US-wide extent, and adding a Conterminous US-wide gridded map layer derived from the vector, plus a new value added look up (valu) table containing ""ready to map"" attributes. The gridded map layer is offered in an ArcGIS file geodatabase raster format. 

The raster and vector map data have a Conterminous US-wide extent. The raster map data have a 10 meter cell size that approximates the vector polygons in an Albers Equal Area projection. Each cell (and polygon) is linked to a map unit identifier called the map unit key. A unique map unit key is used to link to raster cells and polygons to attribute tables, including the new value added look up (valu) table that contains additional derived data.

The value added look up (valu) table contains attribute data summarized to the map unit level using best practice generalization methods intended to meet the needs of most users. The generalization methods include map unit component weighted averages and percent of the map unit meeting a given criteria.

The Gridded SSURGO dataset was created for use in national, regional, and state-wide resource planning and analysis of soils data.

"",Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA),"The United States, Caribbean and Pacific Basin Major Land Resource Areas (MLRA) Geographic Database serves as the geospatial expression of the map products presented and described in Agricultural Handbook 296 (2006).  Land resource categories historically used at State and national levels are land resource units, land resource areas, and land resource regions. Land resource units (LRUs) are the basic units from which major land resource areas (MLRAs) are determined.  They are also the basic units for State land resource maps.  LRUs are typically coextensive with State general soil map units, but some general soil map units are subdivided into LRUs because of significant geographic differences in soils, climate, water resources, or land use.  LRUs generally are several thousand acres in size.  A unit can be one continuous area or several separate areas that are near each other.  In 2005, these areas were designated as common resource areas (CRAs) within the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  CRAs are created by subdividing MLRAs by topography, other landscape features, hydrologic units, resource concerns, resource uses, and human considerations affecting use and soil and water conservation treatment needs.  Common resource areas, or land resource units, are not described in this handbook and are not shown on the national map.  Major land resource areas are geographically associated land resource units.  Land resource regions are a group of geographically associated major land resource areas. Identification of these large areas is important in statewide agricultural planning and has value in interstate, regional, and national planning.  In order to make this handbook more useful to other Federal agencies and private parties using ecological regions for planning or evaluation of natural resources programs and policies, Appendix I (Agriculture Handbook 296, 2006) cross-references MLRAs with Environmental Protection Agency Level III Ecoregions (USEPA, 2003; Omernik, 1987) and U.S. Forest Service ecological sections (Cleland and others, 2005; McNab and others, 2005).  In this handbook, major land resource areas are generally designated by Arabic numbers and identified by a descriptive geographic name.  Examples are MLRA 1 (Northern Pacific Coast Range, Foothills, and Valleys); MLRA 154 (South-Central Florida Ridge); and MLRA 230 (Yukon-Kuskokwim Highlands).  Some MLRAs are designated by an Arabic number and a letter because previously established MLRAs have been divided into smaller, more homogeneous areas, for example, MLRAs 102A, 102B, and 102C.  The use of numbers and letters to identify the newly created MLRAs requires fewer changes in existing information in records and in databases.  A few MLRAs consist of two or more parts separated for short distances by other land resource areas.  In places one of these parts is widely separated from the main body of the MLRA and is in an adjoining LRR.  The description of the respective MLRA also applies to these outlying parts.",text/html,http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov,,005:53,soilshotline@lin.usda.gov,Soils Hotline,,005:027;,NRCS,public,,CRA;Common Resource Area;LRR;LRU;Land Resource Region;Land Resource Unit;MLRA;Major Land Resource Area;NGDA;NGDA Portfolio Theme;National Geospatial Data Asset;Soils Theme;soils;,2015-05-24,,NRCS0106,,,"United State, Territories, Commonwealths, Island Nations",,,,,Geospatial;Soils Theme;National Geospatial Data Asset;,,,,

"",Measuring the Effect of SNAP Participation on Food Security,"SNAP is designed to reduce food insecurity – reduced food intake or disrupted eating patterns in a household due to lack of money or other resources – but data quantifying this effect is limited. The objectives of this study were to: Assess how food security and food expenditures vary with SNAP participation. Examine how relationships between SNAP and food security and between SNAP and food expenditures vary by household characteristics and circumstances. Estimating the effect of SNAP on food insecurity using household survey data is challenging because households that choose to participate in SNAP can differ in systematic ways from households that do not participate, making it hard to distinguish the impact of SNAP from these other factors. This study sought to control for the SNAP participation “selection bias” by comparing information collected from households within days of entering the program (new entrants) to information obtained after about 6 months of participation.",application/pdf,http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/Measuring2013.pdf,,005:84,webmaster@fns.usda.gov,FNS Webmaster,,005:056;,Food and Nutrition Service,public,Public,FNS;Food security;SNAP;household;,2013-08-16,,USDA-FNS-42,,,United States,,,true,,,,,,

"",Aerial Fire Retardant Avoidance Areas: Terrestrial (Feature Layer),"This layer contains features of aerial fire retardant avoidance areas delivered as part of the 2011 Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land Environmental Impact Statement. This Feature Class shows areas, provided by each National Forest who used aerial fire retardant from 2000-2010, where the aerial application of fire retardant should be avoided in order to prevent the potential of impacts to Federally listed threatened or endangered species as identified through consultation, or Forest Service sensitive species. Data includes location of terrestrial and hydrographic areas where the application of aerial fire retardant is to be avoided. Current aerial fire retardant standards prohibit application within 300 feet of hydrographic features. Therefore, this data may contain duplicate hydrographic areas already covered by existing standards. This data is to be used in planning and implementation phases of USFS fire activities to help prevent misapplication of aerial fire retardant in known areas of TES species or water features throughout National Forest lands. Provided here is a National merged dataset derived from each National Forest contribution. This data has been merged, dissolved, and erased of attributes contained in each original component dataset. For this purpose, specific attributes are not necessary, as any spatial areas depicted simply show areas where aerial fire retardant use is to be avoided as stated in USFS guidelines. <a href=""https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.AerialFireRetardantAvoidance.xml"" target=""_blank"">Metadata</a>","text/html, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json, text/csv, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/zip, application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml, application/vnd.ogc.wfs_xml","null, null, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.geojson, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.csv, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.kml, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0.zip, null, null",,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,Fire and Aviation;Aerial;Retardant Avoidance;AFRAA;Terrestrial;Open Data;,2017-08-24,2017-03-27,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/36450fe86e484542b2efab4518217c58_0/license.json,"-124.3891,30.3706,-76.7469,49.0012",,,,,geospatial;,,,,
"",Aerial Fire Retardant Hydrographic Avoidance Areas: Aquatic - Region 1 (Feature Layer),"Aerial retardant avoidance area for hydrographic feature data are based on high resolution National Hydrographic Dataset (NHD) produced by USGS and available from the USFS. Forests and/or regions have had the opportunity to modify the default NHD water representation (300ft buffer from all water features) for their areas of interest to accurately represent aerial fire retardant avoidance areas as described in the 2011 Record of Decision for the Nationwide Aerial Application of Fire Retardant on National Forest System Land EIS. These changes have been integrated into this dataset depicting aerial fire retardant avoidance areas for hydrographic features. The following process was used to develop the hydrographic areas to be avoided by aerial fire retardant. Initially, all intermittent/ephemeral and perennial features were buffered by 300 feet by the Forest/Region units. Subsequently, Forest/Region units may have extended these buffers locally based on their requirements. There may be overlapping features that have been created during the buffering process, so one must dissolve features before calculating any area values. Data is symbolized by FCODE. Using the FCODE attribute, streams/rivers/waterbodies are categorized into perennial and intermittent/ephemeral types. Avoidance features (streams and rivers) with FCODES 46003 and 46007, as well as features (lakes and other waterbody) with FCODES 39001, 39005, 39006, 43614, 46601 are considered intermittent/ephemeral features. All other FCODES are considered to be perennial features. All underground and covered water features (e.g., pipelines) are excluded. When symbolizing this information, perennial features should be drawn on top of intermittent/ephemeral features to give the proper message. Data displays at scales larger than 1:1,250,000. Data uses a Web Mercator projection. The National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico.

"",Data and source code for &quot;A Bayesian model to correct underestimated 3D wind speeds from sonic anemometers increases turbulent components of the surface energy balance&quot;,"Sonic anemometers are the principal instruments in micrometeorological studies of turbulence and ecosystem fluxes. Common designs underestimate vertical wind measurements because they lack a correction for transducer shadowing, with no consensus on a suitable correction. We present a subset of data collected during field experiments in 2011 and 2013 featuring two or four CSAT3 sonic anemometers. We introduce a Bayesian analysis to resolve the three-dimensional correction by optimizing differences between anemometers mounted both vertically and horizontally. A grid of 512 points (~ ±5°resolution in wind location) is defined on a sphere around the sonic anemometer, from which the shadow correction for each transducer-pair is derived from a set of 138 unique state variables describing the quadrants and borders. Using the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, the Bayesian model proposes new values for each state variable, recalculates the fast-response dataset, summarizes the five-minute wind statistics, and accepts the proposed new values based on the probability that they make measurements from vertical and horizontal anemometers more equivalent. MCMC chains were constructed for three different prior distributions describing the state variables: no shadow correction, the Kaimal correction for transducer shadowing, and double the Kaimal correction, all initialized with 10% uncertainty. This archive includes all data and source code required to create the 3-D posterior correction and to analyze its effect during the 2011 and 2013 field experiments plus a 2016 field validation experiment. There are 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2011 and 2013 field experiments contained within 74,664 files (one file each per five-minute period, replicate anemometer, and separated between wind and temperature) and 20 Hz wind velocity and temperature data from the 2016 experiment contained within 1883 files (one file each per each five-minute period, each file contains 3 replicate anemometers). R code is provided to estimate the posterior correction from the 2011 and 2013 wind data using Bayesian analysis assuming three prior corrections: a flat prior, the Kaimal correction, and double the Kaimal correction. Matlab code is provided to normalize, thin, and scale the posterior correction into its final form. Matlab code is provided to apply the posterior correction and to analyze is effect for both sets of data.

"",Expected change in suitable habitat for riparian species along the Rio Grande in New Mexico under changing climate,"Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt 3.3.3) methods were used to estimate expected change in suitable habitat for 12 different wildlife species under changing climate along the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Species include: Lucy's warbler, southwestern willow flycatcher, western yellow-billed cuckoo, New Mexican meadow jumping mouse, Hispid cotton rat, long-legged bat, Occult bat, Yuma bat, black-necked gartersnake, western painted turtle, american bullfrog, and northern leopard frog. These species were selected because their distribution is tied to a habitat or feature characteristic important to multiple species. Models of suitable habitat for each species are based on observation data from collection and survey samples taken from 1970 through 2013. MaxEnt related species' presence to climate, biophysical, and vegetation characteristics. We then projected future suitability of habitats by applying these models to future conditions as predicted by three climate models at three times periods, 2030 (2020-2060), 2060 (2050-2070), and 2090 (2080-2100). The climate data used in this study were derived from the: 1) Canadian Center for Climate Modeling and analysis (CCC) using the CGCM3.1 model, 2) Geophysical Fluid Dynamics laboratory (GFDL) using the CM2.1 model and, 3) Met office, Hadley Centre (HAD), using the HadCM3 model.

"",Fire Program Analysis - Fire Occurrence Database (Feature Layer),"Fire occurrence database 4th edition represents occurrence of wildfires in the United States from 1992 to 2015. This is the third update of a publication originally generated to support the national Fire Program Analysis (FPA) system. The wildfire records were acquired from the reporting systems of federal, state, and local fire organizations. The following core data elements were required for records to be included in this data publication: discovery date, final fire size, and a point location at least as precise as Public Land Survey System (PLSS) section (1-square mile grid). The data were transformed to conform, when possible, to the data standards of the National Wildfire Coordinating Group (NWCG). Basic error-checking was performed and redundant records were identified and removed, to the degree possible. The resulting product, referred to as the Fire Program Analysis fire-occurrence database (FPA FOD), includes 1.88 million geo-referenced wildfire records, representing a total of 140 million acres burned during the 24-year period. <a href=""https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/products/RDS-2013-0009.4/_metadata_RDS-2013-0009.4.html"" target=""_blank"">Metadata</a>","text/html, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json, text/csv, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/zip, application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","null, null, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0.geojson, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0.csv, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0.kml, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0.zip, null",,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,FPA;FOD;Fire Occurrence;Fire and Aviation;USFS;US Forest Service;Fire Program Analysis;Open Data;,2017-12-08,2017-06-23,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/e4d020cb51304d5194860d4464da7ba7_0/license.json,"-178.803,17.94,-65.257,70.331",,,,,geospatial;,,,,

However, as our nation’s forests grow older and more dense, they are at greater risk of attack and new invasive pests can become established. Fortunately, we have projections which can identify tree species at risk of attack well ahead of time. Armed with this and other local information we can be proactive about protecting and restoring our forests to a healthy state.

"",Forest Inventory and Analysis Database,"The Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) research program has been in existence since mandated by Congress in 1928. FIA's primary objective is to determine the extent, condition, volume, growth, and depletion of timber on the Nation's forest land. Before 1999, all inventories were conducted on a periodic basis. The passage of the 1998 Farm Bill requires FIA to collect data annually on plots within each State. This kind of up-to-date information is essential to frame realistic forest policies and programs. Summary reports for individual States are published but the Forest Service also provides data collected in each inventory to those interested in further analysis. Data is distributed via the FIA DataMart in a standard format. This standard format, referred to as the Forest Inventory and Analysis Database (FIADB) structure, was developed to provide users with as much data as possible in a consistent manner among States. A number of inventories conducted prior to the implementation of the annual inventory are available in the FIADB. However, various data attributes may be empty or the items may have been collected or computed differently. Annual inventories use a common plot design and common data collection procedures nationwide, resulting in greater consistency among FIA work units than earlier inventories.

"",Knustson-Vandenberg (Feature Layer),"The Knutson-Vandenberg Act (K-V) of June 9, 1930 (16 U.S.C. 576-576b; 46 Stat. 527), as amended by the National Forest Management Act of October 22, 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600 et seq.) authorized collection of deposits from federal timber purchasers for prompt and efficient use of funds to reestablish, protect, and improve the production of renewable resources on timber sale areas. This includes performing soil improvement and watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, tree planting, seeding and other cultural treatments necessary to maintain and improve land productivity. Since its creation millions of acres of National Forest System lands (NFS) have been treated and restored to resilient conditions and terrestrial and aquatic habitat improved. Public Law 109-54 of August 2, 2005, Title IV �General Provisions, Sec 412 further amended the K-V Act to allow the collection and use of CWKV funds for watershed restoration, wildlife habitat improvement, to prepare timber sales, control of insects, disease, and noxious weeds, fire community protection activities, and the maintenance of forest roads within the Forest Service region in which the timber sale occurred. Provided that such activities may be performed through the use of contracts, forest product sales, and cooperative agreements. Note that these activities are to be performed by contract and not Forest Service personnel. The Forest Service used this amendment to administratively create two K-V programs within the K-V fund; CWKV (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Sale Area Projects) and CWK2 (Cooperative Work, Knutson-Vandenberg, Regional Projects). This layer shows the spatial representation where activities accomplished and funded with CWKV and CWK2 funds and reported through the Forest Service Activity Tracking System (FACTS) database. It is important to note that this layer may not contain all CWKV or CWK2 accomplished activities; the spatial portion of the activity description is not currently enforced by FACTS and at this time some are optionally reported by Forest Service units. As spatial data reporting is enforced by the application and acceptant of reporting both tabular and spatial we hope to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of the data used for this layer in coming years.�<a href=""https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.Activity_KnutsonVandenberg.xml"" target=""_blank"">Metadata</a>","text/html, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json, text/csv, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/zip, application/vnd.ogc.wms_xml","null, null, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.geojson, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.csv, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.kml, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8.zip, null",,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,Knutson Vangenberg Act;Recovery;Activities;Resiliency;Safety;environment;Forest Management;Open Data;,2017-12-01,2017-05-03,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f7dafcc811204aeeb3712b753851cbdd_8/license.json,"-127.112,23.911,-74.729,49.856",,,,,geospatial;,,,,

"",Long-term site responses to season and interval of underburns on the Georgia Piedmont,"Between 1987 and 1988, twenty-four approximately 2-acre plots were established in Jones County, Georgia on the Hitchiti Experimental Forest which is also known as the Brender Demonstration Forest. These plots have not burned since prior to 1939. Treatments were applied to track site changes over time from five short return interval underburn treatments. These treatments, replicated 4 times, were comprised of: biennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season headfires, triennial dormant season backfires, triennial growing season headfires, growing season headfires every 6 years, and unburned controls. Triennial dormant season treatments were eventually combined. Variables tracked over time include the impact of fire on overstory pine growth, midstory (in this study midstory includes understory plants &gt; 4.5 feet high) structure and composition, seedling (in this study including all woody plants &lt; 4.5 feet high and all other plants regardless of height) species dominance, percent cover, pine seedling establishment and mortality, and forest floor consumption. Several thousand overstory and midstory trees were tagged, GPS coordinates recorded and their survival and growth followed over time. Vegetation was measured in nested circular plots and on line transects. Live and dead overstory trees on two 0.2 acre (1/5 ac) subplots per treatment plot were tallied annually by species with diameter at breast height and height, measured and pest damage/mortality by pathogen, lightning and wind damage recorded. Basal area was calculated periodically. Some overstory pines were bored to determine age (typically after death). Midstory live and dead trees were tallied annually on six 0.02 acre subplots per treatment plot. Seedlings were tallied on eighteen 0.001 acre (MA = milacre) subplots per treatment plot by species/species group, and percent of the subplot area in vines, herbs, moss, live woody material, dead plant material, and void of plant material (exposed mineral soil). Six 33 feet line transects per treatment plot were divided into 6 inch segments and dominant seedling species/species group tallied annually. Over 150 species/species groups were identified and tracked over time. Weights of likely available live fuel were determined by species/species group prior to each burn, as were weights of likely available dead fuel for various categories/size classes. Paired postburn samples were collected to determine consumption of various fuel categories. Overstory and midstory pine crown scorch, foliage consumption, and hardwood mortality were tallied within two weeks following each burn. Other vegetation datasets include pine seedling establishment and survival over time on the 18 MA subplots per treatment plot. Red cockaded woodpecker (RCW) related information was collected annually by Region 8 (Southern Region) of the USFS and is available from them. Live and dead fuel moisture data were sampled prior to every burn and can include preburn moisture content grab samples, 10-hour fuel stick readings, and random lumber probe readings. Fire behavior records of headfires and backfires can include rate of spread, flame length, flame angle, flame zone depth, short distance spotting, slopovers, burnout time, and percent of plot burned. The study plan called for observations of fire residence time as well, but such observations were rarely recorded. Weather data include on-plot hand-held instrument observations of surface wind velocity, ambient temperature and relative humidity (RH). On-site data collected can include precipitation, ambient temperature, RH and wind traces from recording gauges. Keetch Byram Drought Index (KBDI) calculation and National Fire danger Rating System NFDRS predictions and other weather observations taken at two nearby Georgia Forestry Commission weather stations were also included.",text/html,null,,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,biota;climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere;Ecology;Ecosystems; Environment;Plant ecology;Fire;Fire ecology;Prescribed fire;Natural Resource Management  Use;Restoration;Timber;fire reintroduction;fire effects;fire behavior;fire damage;southern pine beetle damage;SPB damage;control of unwanted species;lower GA Piedmont vegetation;low intensity fire;hardwood control;old growth loblolly pine site;Joint Fire Science Program;JFSP;multiple species;plants;Hitchiti Experimental Forest;Brender Demonstration Forest;Oconee Ranger District;Chattahoochee National Forest;Georgia;Jones County;Open Data;RDA;,2017-12-01,2017-11-22,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/05e7b05a038041678748b0d66ca7c8ca/license.json,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",,,,,,,,,

In other words: prioritize investment for areas where both hazard is significant and effective treatment can be efficiently implemented.",text/html,null,,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f98c12e761454c629ca15189829eafca,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,NIDRM;FHP;Forest Health;2012;Open Data;,2017-09-29,2017-09-29,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f98c12e761454c629ca15189829eafca,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/f98c12e761454c629ca15189829eafca/license.json,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",,,,,,,,,

"",NorWeST modeled summer stream temperature scenarios for the western U.S.,"NorWeST summer stream temperature scenarios were developed for all rivers and streams in the western U.S. from the &gt; 20,000 stream sites in the NorWeST database where mean August stream temperatures were recorded. The scenarios include: 1) Adobe PDF format maps depicting historical and future modeled mean August stream temperatures, 2) graphs (JPG format) demonstrating the accuracy of the temperature model, and 3) GIS shapefiles (SHP format) representing the spatially modeled stream temperatures. The GIS shapefiles include stream lines and associated mid-points representing 1 kilometer intervals along the stream network. Stream lines were derived from the 1:100,000 scale NHDPlus dataset (USEPA and USGS 2010; McKay et al. 2012). Shapefile extents correspond to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs) or in some instances closely correspond to state borders. The line and point shapefiles contain identical modeled stream temperature results. The two shapefile formats are meant to complement one another for use in different applications. In addition, spatial and temporal covariates used to generate the modeled temperatures are included in the shapefile attribute tables. The NorWeST NHDPlusV1 processing units include: Salmon, Clearwater, Spokoot, Missouri Headwaters, Snake-Bear, MidSnake, MidColumbia, Oregon Coast, South-Central Oregon, Upper Columbia-Yakima, Washington Coast, Upper Yellowstone-Bighorn, Upper Missouri-Marias, and Upper Green-North Platte.

Temperature observations were solicited from state, federal, tribal, private, and municipal resource organizations and processed using a custom cleaning script developed by Gwynne Chandler. Summaries of daily, weekly, and monthly means, minima, and maxima are provided for observation years. The data summaries and location information are available in user-friendly file formats that include: 1) a map (PDF) depicting the locations of in-stream thermographs (temperature sensors) for each processing unit, 2) a GIS shapefile (SHP) containing the location of these sensors for each processing unit, and 3) a tabular file (XLSX) containing observed temperature database summaries for data generally ranging from 1993 to 2015, dependent on the processing unit. Each point shapefile extent corresponds to NorWeST processing units, which generally relate to 6 digit (3rd code) hydrologic unit codes (HUCs). The tabular data can be joined to the observation point shapefile using the ID field OBSPRED_ID.

"",Probabilistic Wildfire Risk,"National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",text/html,null,,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,burn probability;fire intensity;flame length;Ecology;Ecosystems; Environment;CONUS;conterminous United States;Fire;geoscientificInformation;Open Data;,2018-01-03,2017-06-08,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/203afc0fea1a411fa2147ba9c5ef6119/license.json,"-127.738,24.046,-73.949,49.497",,,,,,,,,

RAVG data products characterize vegetation condition within a fire perimeter, and include estimates of percent change in basal area (BA), percent change in canopy cover (CC), and a standardized composite burn index (CBI). Standard thematic products include 7-class percent change in basal area (BA-7), 5-class percent change in canopy cover (CC-5), and 4-class CBI (CBI-4). Contingent upon the availability of suitable imagery, RAVG products are prepared for all wildland fires reported within the conterminous United States (CONUS) that include at least 1000 acres of forested National Forest System (NFS) land (500 acres for Regions 8 and 9 as of 2016). Data for individual fires are typically made available within 45 days after fire containment (&quot;initial assessments&quot;). Late-season fires, however, may be deferred until the following spring or summer (&quot;extended assessments&quot;). National mosaics of each thematic product are prepared annually. This map service includes perimeters for fires that burned during calendar years 2013 through 2016, excluding 2016 extended assessments. The associated raster products (BA-7, CC-5 and CBI-4) are available via the Raster Data Warehouse (RDW, see https://apps.fs.usda.gov/fsgisx01/rest/services/RDW_Wildfire).","text/html, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json, text/csv, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/zip","null, null, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4.geojson, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4.csv, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4.kml, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4.zip",,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,USFS;Forest Service;RAVG;EDW;RDW;Rapid Assessment of Vegetation Change;Fire Perimeters;Vegetation;Fire;Open Data;,2017-08-24,2017-05-18,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0b4c3de263c54f159e26485e8dea4677_4/license.json,"-124.1427,29.2741,-76.973,49.0121",,,,,geospatial;,,,,

The IRA data was originally submitted to the Geospatial Service and Technology Center (GSTC - Located in Salt Lake City Utah) by all national forests through their Regional Offices for the Forest Service?s Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used in the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final stages of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventoried Roadless Areas that were based on existing forest plans and administrative record. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventoried Roadless Areas within Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most forest plans), or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II (Roadless Area Review and Evaluation of 1977 and 1978) information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory, which was established using RARE II information. <a href=""https://data.fs.usda.gov/geodata/edw/edw_resources/meta/S_USA.RoadlessArea_2001.xml"" target=""_blank"">Metadata</a>","text/html, application/json, application/vnd.geo+json, text/csv, application/vnd.google-earth.kml+xml, application/zip","null, null, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0.geojson, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0.csv, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0.kml, http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0.zip",,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,Inventoried Roadless Areas;roadless;EIS;Environmental Impact Statement;2001 Roadless Area Conservation Rule;US Forest Service;Transportation;Open Data;,2017-12-27,2017-04-11,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/a1378467bdc44ea8a21161b031a5c264_0/license.json,"-150.0077,18.2457,-65.7072,61.519",,,,,geospatial;,,,,

"",RxCADRE 2012: In-situ fire behavior measurements,"This data publication contains fire behavior package (FBP) data; primarily flame temperature, horizontal and vertical mass flow, fire intensity, as well as ocular rates of spread (ROS), wind speed and direction data from the Prescribed Fire Combustion and Atmospheric Dynamics Research Experiment (RxCADRE) project conducted in November, 2012. These experiments were conducted on 7 small replicate and 3 large operational prescribed burn blocks in longleaf pine ecosystems on Eglin Air Force Base in Okaloosa County, Florida. Data were collected using three separate sensor systems. The first included sensor/datalogger measurements of convective/radiant energy, temperature and mass flow released by the fire. The second was a digital video camera housed in a fire proof enclosure that recorded visual images of the fire behavior. The third was an array of broadly distributed HOBO micro station anemometers. Both FBP sensor packages and camera system were located nominally 0.5 meters above ground level. The anemometers were 3.05 meters above ground level. The raw data have been processed using calibration data and converted into engineering units. The data provides 10 Hz fire flux measurements (kW/m²), temperature (C), and mass flow (m/sec) in the vertical and horizontal direction per FBP. The anemometer data provide 1 second wind speed and direction as well as 3 second average wind spread, direction and maximum gust.",text/html,null,,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/68a04040ff164bd4a6f13980001caf7c,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,biota;environment;Fire;Fire effects on environment;Fire ecology;Prescribed fire;Ecology;Ecosystems; Environment;prescribed fire;fire behavior;heat flux;temperature;mass flow;wildland fire;wind;anemometer;time series;RxCADRE;Joint Fire Science Program;JFSP;Eglin Air Force Base;Florida;Open Data;RDA;,2017-12-01,2017-11-24,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/68a04040ff164bd4a6f13980001caf7c,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/68a04040ff164bd4a6f13980001caf7c/license.json,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",,,,,,,,,

"",Spatial dataset of probabilistic wildfire risk components for the conterminous United States,"National burn probability (BP) and conditional fire intensity level (FIL) data were generated for the conterminous United States (US) using a geospatial Fire Simulation (FSim) system developed by the US Forest Service Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory to estimate probabilistic components of wildfire risk (Finney et al. [2011]). The FSim system includes modules for weather generation, wildfire occurrence, fire growth, and fire suppression. FSim is designed to simulate the occurrence and growth of wildfires under tens of thousands of hypothetical contemporary fire seasons in order to estimate the probability of a given area (i.e., pixel) burning under current landscape conditions and fire management practices. The data presented here represent modeled BP and FIL for the conterminous US at a 270-meter grid spatial resolution. The six FILs correspond to flame-length classes as follows: FIL1 = &lt; 2 feet (ft); FIL2 = 2 &lt; 4 ft.; FIL3 = 4 &lt; 6 ft.; FIL4 = 6 &lt; 8 ft.; FIL5 = 8 &lt; 12 ft.; FIL6 = 12+ ft. Because they indicate conditional probabilities (i.e., representing the likelihood of burning at a certain intensity level, given that a fire occurs), the FIL*_20160830 data must be used in conjunction with the BP_20160830 data for risk assessment.",text/html,null,,005:96,ebaiello@fs.fed.us,USFS AGOL Admin,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dc4aae9f93064f9496f8731ace6b4583,005:059;,U.S. Forest Service,public,,geoscientificInformation;Ecology;Ecosystems; Environment;Fire;burn probability;flame length;fire intensity;conterminous United States;CONUS;Open Data;RDA;,2017-12-01,2017-11-24,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dc4aae9f93064f9496f8731ace6b4583,,http://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/dc4aae9f93064f9496f8731ace6b4583/license.json,"-180.0,-90.0,180.0,90.0",,,,,,,,,

"",Surface Drinking Water Importance - Forests on the Edge (Feature Layer),"America's private forests provide a vast array of public goods and services, including abundant, clean surface water. Forest loss and development can affect water quality and quantity when forests are removed and impervious surfaces, such as paved roads, spread across the landscape. We rank watersheds across the conterminous United States according to the contributions of private forest land to surface drinking water and by threats to surface water from increased housing density. Private forest land contributions to drinking water are greatest in the East but are also important in Western watersheds. Development pressures on these contributions are concentrated in the Eastern United States but are also found in the North-Central region, parts of the West and Southwest, and the Pacific Northwest; nationwide, more than 55 million acres of rural private forest land are projected to experience a substantial increase in housing density from 2000 to 2030. Planners, communities, and private landowners can use a range of strategies to maintain freshwater ecosystems, including designing housing and roads to minimize impacts on water quality, managing home sites to protect water resources, and using payment schemes and management partnerships to invest in forest stewardship on public and private lands.This data is based on the digital hydrologic unit boundary layer to the Subwatershed (12-digit) 6th level for the continental United States. To focus this analysis on watersheds with private forests, only watersheds with at least 10% forested land and more than 50 acres of private forest were analyzed. All other watersheds were labeled ?Insufficient private forest for this analysis&quot;and coded -99999 in the data table. This dataset updates forest and development statistics reported in the the 2011 Forests to Faucet analysis using 2006 National Land Cover Database for the Conterminous United States, Grid Values=41,42,43,95. and Theobald, Dr. David M. 10 March 2008. bhc2000 and bhc2030 (Housing density for the coterminous US in 2000 and 2030, respectively.)
